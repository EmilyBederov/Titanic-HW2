# Titanic Survival Prediction Project

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting survival outcomes for passengers on the Titanic using machine learning techniques. By analyzing a dataset of passenger information, we explore various features and build predictive models to determine which characteristics most influence survival.

## Project Contents

### Files
- **TitanicPrediction.ipynb**: The main Jupyter Notebook containing the data analysis, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation steps.
- **dataset.csv**: The dataset used for training and testing models, containing information on Titanic passengers such as age, gender, class, and more.

### Key Steps
1. **Data Exploration**: 
   - Visualize and analyze key patterns in the dataset, including correlations between features and survival outcomes.
   
2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Handle missing values and perform feature engineering.
   - Encode categorical variables and scale numerical features as required.

3. **Model Building**:
   - Train several machine learning models, such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests, to predict survival.
   - Fine-tune models using cross-validation and hyperparameter optimization.

4. **Evaluation**:
   - Assess model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and the F1 score.
   - Compare model results to select the best-performing model for survival prediction.
